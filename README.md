I am a computer science major at CSUF and I plan on graduating in 2029.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 5, part 1
This lab was very fun. I was able to implement my understanding of for-loops to calculate the square root of -1. I experemented with while loops against my proffessors advice, ultimatley leading to fruitlessness. When I switched back to for-loops, I was able to better calculate square roots, Leading to a greater sense of accomplishment and understanding.

Lab 8, part 2
Taught me how to play Poker. 18 years and I learn from a computer science class. I integrated If & If-Else statements along with nested loops, for-loops, and nested If statements to allow this program to be successful. This lab taught me to think in multiple levels, Ultimatley Im so glad I learned to finally play.

Lab 2
Not the most entertaininng, but I love this lab for the questions it answered. Helping me undertsand the repository, Github and the terminal. Tools I've never encountered in previous coding courses in highschool. How Github Tokens, and cloning repositories contribute to running the terminal were foriegn concepts that I'm glad to have some understanding over.
